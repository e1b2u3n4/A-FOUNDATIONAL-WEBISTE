  <h1>About</h1>
  Collaborating directly with clients, we create branding systems to digital campaigns for companies large and small. Projects are steered by creative director and founder, Kim Lincon. For projects that need a little more than what can fit on her plate, she relies on her scale-able backup squad of kickass freelancers.
